As If
------

'So that no one will ever say "As If" to your outfit'

Project description 
------

An app to help people find clothes that match, which reduces time spent getting ready in the morning. The app is inspired by the film "Clueless", where the main character selects her clothes from her digital wardrobe. Our app name is based on a quote from the film. 
You can see a five minute presentation of our app here (we are the first group, our demo starts fifteen seconds in), with details of our approach and the challenges that we faced: https://www.facebook.com/MakersAcademy/videos/499418863884299/ 

User Stories

MVP Interaction:
```
As a user,
I can sign up,
So that I can have my own profile.

As a user,
I can log in to my account
So that I can use the website.

As a user,
I can log out of my account
So that my session is closed.

As a user,
I can upload pictures of my clothes
So that they are stored in my account.

As a user,
I can view all the pictures I have uploaded
So that I can make a decision on which clothes to pick.

As a user,
I can select two items of clothes
So that I can compare them by seeing them on the screen.

- Users can save an ensemble that they like and see it saved in their favourites page. They can delete the ensemble from their favourite page if they don't like it anymore. 
- Users can ask for the computer to choose an outfit for them from their favourites collection, so that they don't have to worry about what to wear.


Approach
------

* We used Agile methods, working in sprints, with stand-ups and retros every day. 
* We used a Trello board to keep track of what we needed to do. 
* We used DISC methodology to help us communicate effectively. 

How to Use
--------
- Clone this repo
- Run bundle install
- Run db:create
- Run db:migrate
- "Rails Server" in the console will run the application locally.
- This is the app on Heroku https://clueless-wardrobe.herokuapp.com/combinations 
- However, we had some last minute bugs on Heroku that we struggled to fix in time. The database wipes itself after about an hour and the backgrounds don't appear. If we'd had more time on the project, fixing this would have been a top priority. 

How to Test
-------
- Run RSpec in the terminal
