As If
------

'So that no one will ever say "As If" to your outfit'

Project description 
------

An app to help people find clothes that match, which reduces time spent getting ready in the morning. The app is inspired by the film "Clueless", where the main character selects her clothes from her digital wardrobe. Our app name is based on a quote from the film. 
You can see a five minute demonstration of our app here (we are the first group, our demo starts fifteen seconds in), with details of our approach: https://www.facebook.com/MakersAcademy/videos/499418863884299/ 

User Stories

MVP Interaction:
```
As a user,
I can sign up,
So that I can have my own profile.

As a user,
I can log in to my account
So that I can use the website.

As a user,
I can log out of my account
So that my session is closed.

As a user,
I can upload pictures of my clothes
So that they are stored in my account.

As a user,
I can view all the pictures I have uploaded
So that I can make a decision on which clothes to pick.

As a user,
I can select two items of clothes
So that I can compare them by seeing them on the screen.
```
